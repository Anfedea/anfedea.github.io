The Space-Time/Matter in Gravitational Relativistic Field Theories
------

Philosophical aspects of the Unruh Effect 
------
The Unruh effect—the apparent production of particles as observed by a uniformly accelerated observer—is a striking physical phenomenon that holds significant interest for philosophers. It encapsulates key features of relativistic space-times—without the complications of gravitational effects—and quantum field theory. To explain this effect, many implicit assumptions are typically made, shedding light on various debates within the philosophy and foundations of physics community: the geometrical vs. dynamical approach to space-time, canonical vs. algebraic quantization, and the space-time/matter distinction.



Pluralism in Physics: a case study of Early Universe Cosmology  
------
It is now a widely accepted thesis that different sciences are, as far as we know, incommensurable with one another. Their technologies, theories, and physical objects of study delineate their categories as distinct sciences. However, a stronger thesis is the assertion that incommensurability can also occur within a single science, such as physics.

Against the unificationist view—which holds that all physics can converge into a unified theory with a singular set of objects and observations—I argue that different fields of physics, even when not entirely compatible with each other, can overlap in regions of shared interest. This overlap is a key feature that makes physics so successful. As an example, I am currently working on the use of local thermal equilibrium in early universe cosmology, where such pluralistic approaches yield insightful results.

History of Modern Physics
======
The history of 20th-century physics is layered with numerous discoveries, many of which are typically categorized and studied separately. However, in some cases, these discoveries overlap, and certain developments are often overlooked in standard historical accounts.

One such case is the origin of quantum field theory in curved space-time, a theory developed parallel to larger programs in quantum gravity. I am studying the early foundational results of this field and argue that, as a successful theory, it has provided robust support for the quantum gravity program—an area that often lacks consistent and rigorous theoretical results.

Quantum Field Theory in Curved Space-time and Cosmology
======
Quantum field theory in curved space-time is now a well-established framework that models space-time using a curved (classical) metric and matter as quantum fields propagating within this space-time. While the theory has yielded many significant theoretical and potentially testable results, several fundamental questions remain unanswered.

One pressing issue is the construction of physically motivated quantum states that account for vacuum polarization effects, quantum fluctuations, and thermal effects. Another is the development of computationally efficient tools to solve the coupled differential equations of the semi-classical Einstein equations. These equations must also be properly renormalized to address the standard divergences of quantum field theory. Addressing these challenges is crucial for achieving a complete understanding of quantum effects in the early universe, which this theory has the potential to provide.
