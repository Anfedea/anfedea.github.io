The Space-Time/Matter in Gravitational Relativistic Field Theories
------

Philosophical aspects of the Unruh Effect 
------
The Unruh effect- the apparent production of particles on an uniform accelerated- is a striking physical effect that is of great interest for philosophers since it has key features of relativistic space-times- without the complications of graviational effects- and quantum field theory. To explain this effect, many implict assumptions are usually considered, which tells us important information about different debates within the philosophy/foundation of phsyics community: geometrical vs dynamical approach to space-time, canonical vs alegrabraic quantization and the spacetime/matter disctintion. 

Pluralism in Physics: a case study of Early Universe Cosmology  
------
It is by now a well accepted thesis that differente sciences are, as far we know, incomersurable between each other. Their technology, theories, physical objects of studies, etc, delimitate their category as science. However, a stronger thesis is the assumption that the same happens within a proper science, for instance in physics. Againts the unificationist view that all physics would be able to converge in a unique theory and a unique set of objects and observations, I claim that diferend fields in physics that are not all compatible with each other are able  overlap regions of interest, a key feature that makes it so successfull. As an example I am currenty working on the use of local thermal equilibrium in early universe cosmology. 

History of Modern Physics
======
History of last century physics is stocked with many layers of discoveries that can be ussualy discriminated between each other, but in some cases, they overlap and many discoveriries are overlook in typical historial reviews. This is the case of the origin of quantum field theory in curved space-time, a theory that was posed parallel to bigger programs of quantum gravity. I am studying the first key results of this field, and argue that as a successull theory it has provided a strong argument for the quantum gravity program, which by itselfs usually lacks consistent and rigurous theoretical results. 

Quantum Field Theory in Curved Space-time and Cosmology
======
Quantum field theory in curved space-time is by now a robust theory that considers space-time described by a curved (classical) metric and matter by quantum fields that propagate under this space-time. Many important theoretical and potentially verifiable results have been found, but still big questions require a detailed account. In particular, a proper description of quantum effects in the early universe, which in principle this theory could provide. This faces at least two key issues. First, the construction of physically motivated quantum states that account for vacuum polarization effects, quantum fluctuations and thermal effects. Second, a computational efficient toold to solve the coupled differential equations of the semi-classical Einsteins equations, which additional required to properly renormalize the theory to overcome standard divergences of quantum field theory.
