During that year and the subsequent master’s program, I began my research career in the field of Quantum Field Theory in curved spacetime (QFTcs), a framework where gravity is treated as a classical metric field, as described by General Relativity, while matter is modeled as quantum fields satisfying the usual requirements of quantum field theory in flat spacetime. I chose this topic because it allowed me to study and understand various well-established fields of physics, such as cosmology and particle physics, in a formal way. I defended my Ph.D. thesis on renormalization techniques in quantum field theory in cosmological spacetimes in 2021. During those years, I was fortunate to attend many schools worldwide on diverse topics (cosmology, particle physics, mathematical methods, quantum gravity, etc.) and completed a research stay at the University of Basel (with another planned stay canceled due to COVID-19).

In parallel with my physics career, I pursued a master’s degree in Philosophy of Science and Logic. I can’t pinpoint the exact reason why I chose it; I wanted to study something beyond physics, and it seemed like a subject that I could enjoy and understand with my physics background. As it turned out, I truly enjoyed the master’s program and learned a great deal about the philosophy of various sciences (physics, biology, sociology, etc.) and broader philosophical topics (phenomenology and existentialism). My master’s thesis focused on Philip Kitcher and his understanding of scientific research programs in democratic societies. After completing the program, I continued studying and learning about these topics, though I didn’t pursue formal research due to my full-time dedication to physics.

In 2021, I was awarded an Irish Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship by the Government of Ireland. This allowed me to undertake my own research project at Dublin City University on topics related to quantum fields in the early universe. Specifically, I aimed to understand how quantum effects occur during the inflationary and reheating phases of the universe and whether QFTcs could describe the mechanisms required to explain the observed data in the Cosmic Microwave Background. During this time, I conducted a research stay at the University of Pavia, where I also learned about algebraic quantum field theory and addressed the imprecise results often obtained within the field. Together with some colleagues, we organized a highly successful online conference on QFTcs, which was held again in person over the following two years in Granada and Lisbon.

The next academic year, I moved to Nijmegen (Netherlands) as a Margarita Salas Fellow at Radboud University. My project there focused on a Lorentzian formulation of the Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity program. During this time, I also served as a teaching assistant for the Quantum Gravity course taught by Renate Loll, which familiarized me with various approaches to quantum gravity.

After that year, I received an offer from Utrecht University for a three-year postdoctoral position within the newly established UPAC (Utrecht Philosophy of Astronomy and Cosmology) group led by Niels Martens. I am now part of the ERC Cosmo-Master project, which explores the space-time/matter dichotomy in cosmology and astrophysics. In addition to my research, I have been a teaching assistant for courses such as The Quantum World, Philosophy of Space and Time, and Philosophy of Science, all part of the university’s Master’s program in Philosophy of Science. More details about my current research can be found here: [My Research](https://anfedea.github.io/My%20Research/).

Lastly, I am deeply passionate about teaching and supervising bachelor’s and master’s students. I have supervised one bachelor’s thesis (which received the highest grade in its class) and four master’s theses, one of which resulted in a published paper, and two of which are ongoing collaborations. Currently, I am co-supervising Andrea Cavallaro’s master’s thesis on the philosophical aspects of the Unruh Effect as part of his Erasmus internship. If you are a bachelor’s or master’s student interested in joining the UPAC group for your thesis, Erasmus stay, or a similar opportunity, don’t hesitate to contact me.
