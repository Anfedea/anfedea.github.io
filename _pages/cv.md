After graduating high school in my hometown Ourense (Spain), I moved to Valencia to start the Degree in Physics. During the first two courses, funny enough I mostly enjoyed the mathematical courses (alegbra and complex variable), and it was not until the third year during my erasmus stay at the University of Bonn (Germany) that I was atracted by pure physics courses: electrodynamics, general relativity, quantum mechanics and cosmology. When I cam back for my last year in Valencia, I wanted to a thesis related with Kaluza-Klein theories, but
